# rosalind-in-rust

my solutions in rust (with help from GitHub copilot) for bioinformatics exercises on [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/).

The code is in `src/bin/`, with a file per exercise (at least for now). Code can be compiled into binaries, but I suggest to run it with `cargo run --bin <name of binary>`, e.g. `cargo run --bin dna`.
